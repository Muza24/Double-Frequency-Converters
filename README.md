A double frquency converter is designed in place of a traditional boost converter. The idea implemented is from the paper "Design and Implementation of Double Frequency Boost Converter" (doi: https://doi.org/10.1109/INCET54531.2022.9825420). Due to 
high voltage stress, a regular step-up converter cannot maintain high gain, a high-frequency converter has poor performance, and a low-frequency converter has low efficiency. As a result of the dual frequency converter, performance, efficiency, and gain have all improved. The designed converter has helped to improve the transient performance along with the steady state performance.
